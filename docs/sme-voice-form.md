# NBX Company Survey

NBX is a participant of the NSE innovation lab aimed at finding out how technology can be used to enhance capital access to SMEs like yourself. The innovation lab was announced in early 2025. The NSE announcement on YouTube can be shown at the bottom of the survey page.

## INFORMATION SECTION: Capital Alternatives for Your Business

Informed entrepreneurs make powerful decisions. Read on to learn about two powerful tools NBX makes available.

### Bonds: A Cheaper Alternative to Bank Loans

A bond is a loan you take from the public (investors), not from a bank.

#### Corporate Bonds vs Bank Loans: How it works

1. Your business issues a bond (a promise to repay investors with interest).
2. Investors buy the bond, effectively lending you money.
3. You pay periodic interest (coupon payments).
4. At maturity, you repay the principal.

Why bonds can be better than loans:

- Lower cost: by cutting out the bank as middleman, you can offer investors around 10% interest while a bank might charge around 16%.
- No collateral required in most cases.
- You set the terms: repayment period, interest rate, and conditions.
- Builds credibility: issuing a bond signals business maturity and transparency.

On NBX, SMEs can issue tokenized bonds on the Hedera blockchain, making the process faster, cheaper, and accessible to hundreds of investors at once.

### Equity Offerings: Raise Capital by Sharing Ownership

An equity offering means selling a portion of your company's ownership (shares) to investors in exchange for capital.

How it works:

1. You decide what percentage of your company to offer (e.g., 20%).
2. Investors buy those shares, becoming part-owners.
3. You receive the capital immediately with no repayment obligation.
4. Investors benefit if your business grows and shares increase in value.

Key benefits of equity over debt:

- Security Token Offering (STO): shares are tokenized, fractional, tradable, and open to many investors.
- Dividend rights: profit sharing can be committed and automated through smart contracts.
- Governance rights: shareholders can vote on major business decisions.

NBX makes equity raising accessible to SMEs that would not qualify to list on the traditional Nairobi Securities Exchange, with lower costs, faster processing, and built-in compliance.

Thank you for your time. Your responses will directly influence how NBX is designed to serve businesses like yours.

This survey is confidential. Data is used solely for NBX platform development purposes.
